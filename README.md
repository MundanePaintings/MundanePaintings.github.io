- What is the meaning of Mundane?

Mundane is an adjective that means ordinary and not interesting in any way and for us this is a myth
because we think that all people have a passion in something , only it has not been found.

- What is Mundane?

Mundane is a website which has several functions. The main idea of the site is to buy and sell
paintings painted by casual artists, we also have painters who paint realistic replicas of well-known
paintings that you can buy for a small price.

In Mundane you can also see the history of the most famous painters of all times, with their most
famous paintings and a bit of the history of the times in which they lived.

This business idea comes from the fact that there are not many websites (and the ones there are,
have a very old design) where you, as a casual painter, can sell your paintings to real art lovers and
buy the paintings of not very well known painters.

-------- This is a playful website (not all functions are available, they are in progress)  --------
